# DSM-5 Major Depressive Disorder Criteria Registry
#
# This is the CANONICAL criterion mapping for the Evidence Binding Pipeline.
# All code, evaluation scripts, and paper tables MUST reference this registry.
#
# Source: DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition)
# Section: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Criterion A
#
# Note on A.10:
#   The DSM-5 MDD Criterion A has 9 symptom criteria (A.1-A.9).
#   A.10 in this system represents the Duration Criterion from DSM-5 MDD,
#   which requires symptoms to be present for at least 2 weeks.
#   This is treated as a separate retrieval task for clinical completeness.

criteria:
  A.1:
    short_name: "Depressed Mood"
    dsm5_number: 1
    full_description: >
      Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either
      subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made
      by others (e.g., appears tearful).
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Core criterion - most common presenting symptom"

  A.2:
    short_name: "Anhedonia"
    dsm5_number: 2
    full_description: >
      Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities
      most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account
      or observation).
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Core criterion - often co-occurs with A.1"

  A.3:
    short_name: "Weight/Appetite Change"
    dsm5_number: 3
    full_description: >
      Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of
      more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite
      nearly every day.
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Can manifest as either increase or decrease"

  A.4:
    short_name: "Sleep Disturbance"
    dsm5_number: 4
    full_description: >
      Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Commonly reported symptom"

  A.5:
    short_name: "Psychomotor Changes"
    dsm5_number: 5
    full_description: >
      Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others,
      not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Must be observable, not just subjective"

  A.6:
    short_name: "Fatigue/Loss of Energy"
    dsm5_number: 6
    full_description: >
      Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Highly prevalent in depression"

  A.7:
    short_name: "Worthlessness/Guilt"
    dsm5_number: 7
    full_description: >
      Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be
      delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Cognitive symptom - may be delusional in severe cases"

  A.8:
    short_name: "Concentration Difficulty"
    dsm5_number: 8
    full_description: >
      Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
      (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Cognitive symptom affecting daily function"

  A.9:
    short_name: "Suicidal Ideation"
    dsm5_number: 9
    full_description: >
      Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation
      without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
    in_paper: true
    notes: "Critical safety criterion - requires clinical attention"
    priority: high

  A.10:
    short_name: "Duration (2+ weeks)"
    dsm5_number: null  # Not a numbered DSM-5 criterion
    full_description: >
      Duration criterion: The symptoms have been present for at least 2 weeks
      (required for MDD diagnosis per DSM-5). This criterion captures temporal
      references in user posts that indicate symptom duration.
    in_paper: true
    notes: >
      This is the Duration Criterion from DSM-5 MDD diagnostic requirements.
      It is modeled as a separate retrieval task to identify temporal markers
      in posts that indicate symptom persistence. Lower AUROC (0.66) expected
      due to difficulty of extracting duration information from unstructured text.
