# Ethics Statement

This document describes the ethical considerations, privacy protections, and compliance measures for the Evidence Binding Pipeline research project.

---

## Overview

This research involves analyzing social media posts from mental health communities to develop NLP tools for evidence extraction. We take privacy and ethical considerations seriously.

---

## Data Source and Collection

### Source
- Data collected from public Reddit posts in mental health communities
- Posts were publicly visible at time of collection
- No private messages or protected content was accessed

### Collection Protocol
- Data collected for research purposes only
- Collection methods complied with Reddit's Terms of Service at time of collection
- No user accounts were created or manipulated for data collection

---

## Privacy Protections

### Anonymization
All data has been anonymized to prevent re-identification:

1. **Username removal**: All Reddit usernames have been removed or replaced with random identifiers
2. **Post ID anonymization**: Original Reddit post IDs are not stored; internal IDs are used
3. **Temporal information**: Timestamps have been removed or generalized
4. **Identifying information**: Any personally identifying information (names, locations, specific dates) has been redacted

### Storage Security
- Data stored on encrypted drives
- Access restricted to authorized researchers
- No cloud storage of raw data
- Audit logs maintained for data access

### Re-identification Risk
- We have assessed re-identification risk as low due to:
  - Removal of usernames and post IDs
  - Generalization of temporal information
  - Redaction of identifying details
- We do not attempt to re-identify any individuals

## Ethical Review

### Institutional Review
- Research protocol reviewed by institutional ethics committee
- Determination: Exempt/Approved (details withheld for anonymity)
- Protocol number available upon request after peer review

### Ethical Considerations
1. **Beneficence**: Research aims to improve mental health screening tools
2. **Non-maleficence**: No direct contact with data subjects; no intervention
3. **Autonomy**: Data subjects posted publicly; no consent required for public data analysis
4. **Justice**: Tools developed will be available for research community

## Intended Use and Misuse Prevention

### Intended Use
- Research into NLP methods for mental health
- Development of clinical decision support tools
- Academic publication and reproducibility

### NOT Intended For
- Individual diagnosis without clinical oversight
- Surveillance or monitoring of individuals
- Commercial profiling or targeting
- Law enforcement purposes

### Safeguards
- Code is released under MIT license for research
- Documentation emphasizes clinical oversight requirement
- No individual-level predictions provided without context

---

## Sensitive Content Handling

### Suicidal Ideation (Criterion A.9)
- This research includes analysis of posts mentioning suicidal ideation
- Content is handled with appropriate sensitivity:
  - Not displayed in public demos without warning
  - Researchers trained in appropriate handling
  - Crisis resources available in documentation

### Mental Health Stigma
- We avoid language that stigmatizes mental health conditions
- Technical terminology is clinical and neutral
- We acknowledge the lived experience of individuals with depression

---

## Dual-Use Considerations

### Potential Benefits
- Improved screening efficiency
- Earlier detection of mental health concerns
- Reduced clinician workload
- Standardized evidence extraction

### Potential Risks
- Over-reliance on automated tools
- False positives/negatives in clinical settings
- Privacy concerns if deployed without safeguards
- Potential for misuse in non-clinical contexts

### Mitigation
- Clear documentation of limitations
- Emphasis on human-in-the-loop requirement
- Publication of performance bounds and failure modes
- Restricted access to sensitive data

---

## Compliance

### Platform Terms of Service
- Data collection complied with Reddit Terms of Service
- Data used for research purposes only
- No commercial use of data

### Data Protection
- GDPR considerations: Data minimization, purpose limitation
- No EU personal data knowingly collected
- Right to erasure: Contact authors if you believe your data is included

### Research Standards
- Adherence to ACM Code of Ethics
- Following best practices for NLP research ethics
- Transparent reporting of methods and limitations
