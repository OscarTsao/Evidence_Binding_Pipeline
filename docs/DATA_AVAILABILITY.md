# Data Availability Statement

This document describes the data used in the Evidence Binding Pipeline research project and procedures for data access.

## Overview

The research uses sensitive mental health data that cannot be publicly shared. We provide detailed documentation to support reproducibility while protecting participant privacy.

## Data Access Procedures

### For Academic Researchers

1. **Initial Contact**
   - Email: [contact authors]
   - Include: Institution, research purpose, planned analyses

2. **Requirements**
   - IRB approval (or equivalent ethics approval from your institution)
   - Completed data use agreement
   - Agreement to data handling protocols

3. **Data Use Agreement Terms**
   - Data used only for stated research purposes
   - No re-identification attempts
   - No redistribution without authorization
   - Proper citation of original work
   - Secure storage (encrypted at rest)
   - Deletion upon project completion

4. **Review Process**
   - Initial review: 1-2 weeks
   - DUA execution: 1-2 weeks
   - Data transfer: Secure method arranged individually

### For Industry/Commercial Use

Commercial use requires separate licensing. Contact authors to discuss terms.

## Privacy Protections

### Anonymization

- All usernames removed/hashed
- Identifying information redacted
- Post IDs are arbitrary identifiers (not Reddit IDs)
- Temporal information removed

### Access Controls

- Data stored on encrypted drives
- Access limited to approved researchers
- Audit logs maintained
- Annual access review

### Ethical Considerations

- Data collected from public posts, but treated as sensitive
- Research protocol approved by [IRB/Ethics Board]
- Protocol number: [To be filled]
- Participants cannot be re-contacted (anonymous)

## Reproducibility Without Data

Researchers without data access can still:

1. **Verify Code Logic**
   - All source code is available
   - Unit tests validate metric computations
   - Configuration files document hyperparameters

2. **Use Synthetic Data**
   - Generate synthetic data matching schema
   - Test pipeline functionality
   - Validate metric implementations

3. **Apply to Similar Datasets**
   - Pipeline generalizes to similar retrieval tasks
   - Adapters for different data formats documented
   - Configuration system allows easy customization

### Synthetic Data Generation

```python
# Example: Generate synthetic data for testing
import pandas as pd
import random

def generate_synthetic_posts(n_posts=100, sentences_per_post=10):
    """Generate synthetic posts matching expected schema."""
    posts = []
    for i in range(n_posts):
        sentences = [f"Sentence {j} of post {i}." for j in range(sentences_per_post)]
        posts.append({
            "post_id": f"synthetic_{i:04d}",
            "text": " ".join(sentences)
        })
    return pd.DataFrame(posts)

def generate_synthetic_annotations(posts_df, criteria, evidence_rate=0.19):
    """Generate synthetic annotations."""
    annotations = []
    for _, post in posts_df.iterrows():
        for criterion in criteria:
            has_evidence = random.random() < evidence_rate
            if has_evidence:
                annotations.append({
                    "post_id": post["post_id"],
                    "criterion": criterion,
                    "evidence_sentence_idx": random.randint(0, 9)
                })
    return pd.DataFrame(annotations)
```
